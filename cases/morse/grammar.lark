// Generate a grammar for Lark using the Earley parser that can parse valid Morse code messages using the following rules:
//- A Morse code character is made up of one or more dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`), with no spaces in between.
//- Each Morse code character is separated from the next by optional whitespace (` `).
//- Words in Morse code are separated by a slash (`/`) surrounded by optional whitespace (e.g., `" / "`).
//- Only letters A–Z and digits 0–9 are allowed.
//- Do not define the meaning of each Morse sequence; just ensure the grammar accepts sequences that could represent valid Morse code messages.
//- Comments in the grammar are allowed to clarify intent.
// Provide the grammar such that it accepts an input like: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
// which corresponds to "HELLO WORLD".
