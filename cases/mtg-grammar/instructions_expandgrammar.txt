🧠 Task: Expand a Lark Grammar to Support More Magic: The Gathering Cards
You are developing a Lark grammar (using the Earley parser) to parse valid Magic: The Gathering (MTG) rules text. The current version of the grammar is located at:

cases/mtg/grammar.lark

Your goal is to expand this grammar so that it can parse a larger portion of real MTG card texts, based on the dataset provided. However, as you expand the grammar, you must prioritize clean design, generalizable patterns, and readability — not one-off hacks to get individual cards working.

🎯 Objective Summary
Write new rules to increase parse coverage while keeping the grammar concise, general, and maintainable.

This means:

✅ Consolidate similar phrases under shared nonterminals

✅ Introduce reusable patterns instead of copy-pasting variants

✅ Use descriptive rule names for structure (e.g., combat_trigger, sacrifice_clause, mana_production)

❌ Do not hardcode one-off constructions that only match a single card

Note that whenever you take a shortcut or introduce an ambiguity into the grammar, it slows everything down.
Running driver.py currently takes 121 seconds with eight processes. Do NOT cancel the driver while it is running, it is guaranteed
to halt.


🧪 Evaluate Your Grammar
Use the following command to test how many card texts are successfully parsed by your grammar:

python driver.py --grammar_file cases/mtg/grammar.lark --input_file cases/mtg/inputs.txt

This will report how many MTG cards in inputs.txt were parsed successfully. Your goal is to maximize this number without sacrificing grammar quality.

Note you will need to install Lark for the script to work. You can install it using "pip lark install".

🛠️ Sanity Check (Optional)
To verify the parsing pipeline works as expected, try the a^n b^n c^n toy grammar:

python driver.py --grammar_file cases/an_bn_cn/grammar.lark --input_file cases/an_bn_cn/inputs.txt --transformer cases.an_bn_cn.transformer

👨‍🏫 Style Guidelines
✅ Use case-insensitive literals ("Target"i)
✅ Structure the grammar with readable nonterminal names
✅ Add comments to group related rules (e.g., “# combat actions”)
✅ Reuse patterns where possible; generalize, don’t duplicate

📚 Know the Language of Magic
To better understand what words and constructions are legal in MTG card text, consult the official Magic Comprehensive Rules:

This file includes valid terms, creature types, and phrasing conventions that you should incorporate into the grammar.
