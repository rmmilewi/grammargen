🧠 Task: Expand a Lark Grammar to Support More Magic: The Gathering Cards
You are developing a Lark grammar (using the Earley parser) to parse valid Magic: The Gathering (MTG) rules text. The current version of the grammar is located at:

cases/mtg/grammar.lark

Your goal is to expand this grammar so that it can parse a larger portion of real MTG card texts, based on the dataset provided. However, as you expand the grammar, you must prioritize clean design, generalizable patterns, and readability — not one-off hacks to get individual cards working.

🎯 Objective Summary
Write new rules to increase parse coverage while keeping the grammar concise, general, and maintainable.

This means:

✅ Consolidate similar phrases under shared nonterminals

✅ Introduce reusable patterns instead of copy-pasting variants

✅ Use descriptive rule names for structure (e.g., combat_trigger, sacrifice_clause, mana_production)

❌ Do not hardcode one-off constructions that only match a single card


🧪 Evaluate Your Grammar
Use the following command to test how many card texts are successfully parsed by your grammar:

python driver.py --grammar_file cases/mtg/grammar.lark --input_file cases/mtg/inputs.txt

This will report how many MTG cards in inputs.txt were parsed successfully. Your goal is to maximize this number without sacrificing grammar quality.

🛠️ Sanity Check (Optional)
To verify the parsing pipeline works as expected, try the a^n b^n c^n toy grammar:

python driver.py --grammar_file cases/an_bn_cn/grammar.lark --input_file cases/an_bn_cn/inputs.txt --transformer cases.an_bn_cn.transformer

👨‍🏫 Style Guidelines
✅ Use case-insensitive literals ("Target"i)
✅ Structure the grammar with readable nonterminal names
✅ Add comments to group related rules (e.g., “# combat actions”)
✅ Reuse patterns where possible; generalize, don’t duplicate

📚 Know the Language of Magic
To better understand what words and constructions are legal in MTG card text, consult the official Magic Comprehensive Rules:

This file includes valid terms, creature types, and phrasing conventions that you should incorporate into the grammar.
